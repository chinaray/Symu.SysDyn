``Symu.SysDyn`` is part of ``Symu Suite``, for organizational modeling, analysis and simulating.
``Symu.SysDyn`` is a core of system dynamics models library, written in C#.

## How it works

``Symu.SysDyn`` compute models from standard xmile file or code based.

## What it is

It creates a graph of system dynamics artifacts and graphical to model complex systems to analyze.

## Why open source

Because we believe that such a framework is valuable for organizations and academics, because there are few c # frameworks available.

## Getting Started
The API is [Symu.SysDyn](https://github.com/lmorisse/Symu.SysDyn/tree/master/sourceCode/SymuSysDyn). This is the framework you'll use to build your own application.
The GUI is [Symu.SysDynApp](https://github.com/lmorisse/Symu.SysDyn/tree/master/sourceCode/SymuSysDynApp).
